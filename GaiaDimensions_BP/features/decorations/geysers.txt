1. place 4-5 small pools at random points at a radius of 6 blocks from the center 
rand = random(0,2pi)
x = cos(rand)*6
y = -3
z = sin(rand)*6

2. place 1-2 med pools at radius of 4 blocks
rand = random(0,2pi)
x = cos(rand)*4
y = -2
z = sin(rand)*4

3. place 1 large pool
rand = random(0,2pi)
x = 0
y = -1
z = 0
